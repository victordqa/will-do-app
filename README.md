# will-do-app

Will Do App is an app for very simple self management (to-do-list). 
This app was build for learning purposes, based on Traversy Media You Tube Series - "Learn the MERN Stack". Main learning objectives:

* Build and deploy fullstack MERN app,
* REDUX,
* Password hash and salt,
* User Authentication using JSON  Web  Token.

Main changes when compared to original tutorial:

* No bootstrap used to exercise front-end skills,
* Used styled-components for styling
* Changed the app from a shopping list, where all authenticated users can see and edit the items of the list, to a to-do list, where
  users can only visualize and change their own tasks.
